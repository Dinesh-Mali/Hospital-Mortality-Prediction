# Hospital-Mortality-Prediction
In this project, we will be predict the hospital mortality using ML models.

# Introduction
Main aim of this project is to predict the mortality rate , whether a person will live or not with help of different ML algoritms

# Project Flow

1) Data Analysis - Finding out Different relations.

2) Feature Engineering - Processing the data before it feeding to the model.

3) Model Building using ML - Using ML/Dl Algorithms.

4) Model Building using Auto ML.
